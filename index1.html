		It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web alongside HTML and CSS.
		JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language that allows client-side scripts to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.
		It is unique because it can run directly in the browser, not just on a server.3 JavaScript functions can improve a website's user experience, from refreshing social media feeds to displaying animations and interactive maps.0 As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries</p>
